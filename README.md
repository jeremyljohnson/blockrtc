# BlockRTC (Block Real Time Communication)

This project is a framework for creating, deploying, and interacting with the Ethereum blockchain to provide completely decentralized access to audio and video communication infrastructure that can support live meetings of up to 50 participants

IMPORTANT NOTE: The original source code is based on a separate project, kickstart, which is essentially kickstarter with the addition of controls over how the owner of a successfully funded project can spend the proceeds

All of this code will need to be refactored and adapted, but was left in place as an example, since many of the same concepts apply to both projects

# The Smart Contract
Please see Ethereum/Contracts/Campaign.sol lines 100+
